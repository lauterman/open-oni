# Open ONI Ubuntu Installation

Open ONI does not currently maintain Ubuntu documentation in favor of using
Docker configuration for instructions.

You may follow along with the steps Docker takes, starting with
[Dockerfile](/docker/Dockerfile) and using supporting files found in
[the docker directory](/docker).

It may be helpful to refer to the [CentOS](/docs/install-centos) documentation
to understand how pieces of software such as MariaDB, Solr, Apache, and RAIS
work together with Open ONI.
